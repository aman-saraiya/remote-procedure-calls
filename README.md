# Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) Repository

This repository serves as a hands-on exploration of different RPC (Remote Procedure Call) frameworks and implementation strategies, with a specific focus on **gRPC** and **standard RPC implementations** in Go.

This repository contains the source code for the implementations discussed in the following articles:

- [**gRPC is not the only RPC framework: Exploring Remote Procedure Calls**](https://medium.com/@aman-saraiya/grpc-is-not-the-only-rpc-framework-exploring-remote-procedure-calls-1ba90f9adb0c)
- [**A Deep Dive into gRPC: Service Definitions, Protobufs, and Hands-On Implementation**](https://medium.com/@aman-saraiya/a-deep-dive-into-grpc-service-definitions-protobufs-and-hands-on-implementation-777946d733ca)

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into two main directories:

- **`rpc-go-standard/`**: Contains a basic implementation of standard RPC in Go, demonstrating core concepts and practices.
- **`grpc-protobuf/`**: Contains a gRPC implementation using Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) for service definitions, message serialization, and communication.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need to have **Go 1.23.3** installed on your local machine. You can find instructions on how to install Go [here](#link-to-go-installation-guide).

Each directory (`rpc-go-standard/` and `grpc-protobuf/`) will further have specific setup instructions and dependencies, which will be provided in their respective `README` files.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork this repository, open issues, or submit pull requests if you have suggestions, improvements, or enhancements related to RPC implementations!
